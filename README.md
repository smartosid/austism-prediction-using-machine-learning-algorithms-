# üß† Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on early prediction of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using machine learning models trained on behavioral screening data. The goal is to support early screening and diagnosis using simple, structured data inputs.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from publicly available autism screening data, which typically includes:

- Responses to behavioral screening questions (Yes/No)
- Demographic attributes (Age, Gender, Ethnicity, etc.)
- Family history
- Result from standard autism screening tools

> Dataset format: `.csv`  
> Target column: `Class/ASD_Traits`

## üß™ Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
